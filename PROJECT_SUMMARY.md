- Database seeding scripts
- Automated setup process

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (Flask)
- **app.py**: Main Flask application with all API endpoints
- **models.py**: SQLAlchemy models for database schema
- **config.py**: Configuration management with environment variables
- **setup_database.py**: Database initialization script
- **seed_data.py**: Data population from external API

### Frontend (React)
- **PlayerList.js**: Main component displaying all players with sorting
- **PlayerCard.js**: Individual player card component
- **PlayerDetail.js**: Modal showing detailed player information
- **EditPlayerForm.js**: Form for editing player data
- **api.js**: Service layer for API communication

### Database Schema
```sql
players (
  id, name, team, position, age,
  hits, home_runs, batting_average, rbi, stolen_bases,
  created_at, updated_at
)
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run automated setup
./setup.sh

# Or manual setup:
cd backend && python setup_database.py && python seed_data.py && python run.py
cd frontend && npm install && npm start
```

### Configuration
1. Set up PostgreSQL database
2. Configure `.env` file with database credentials
3. Add OpenAI API key for LLM descriptions
4. Run setup scripts

## 📊 API Endpoints
